## Identify Categorical Values

An online car broker wants to understand what car features influence customer car ratings on their site. Customers rate cars as unaccpetable, acceptable, very good, and good. The `cars` dataset captures customer ratings and other car features. The goal is to run a decision tree model at the end of this section to find out what car features influence better ratings for cars. Initially, the `car` dataset must be cleaned before the model may be completed.  

**Categorical variables** are used to describe everything around us. For example, categorical variables that describe people are: 
- gender, 
- occupation, 
- blood type, and 
- marital status

As a data scientist, you will may need to translate categorical variables into numerical variables for analysis, visualization, and modeling. Many python packages are not able to analyze categorical values in string format. 

Explore the `cars` data: 

- Print out the first few rows and all columns by using `head()`
- Print out list of all columns variables by using `columns`

By looking at columns names alone, which `cars` dataset variables are categorical?

*** =instructions
- Buying Price
- Number of Doors
- Customer Rating
- all of the above

*** =hint
- The `cars` dataset has been preloaded in this exercise as a pandas dataframe. Type "cars" into command line to print out all the values of cars. 
- Do you remember the panda's syntax for head() and columns? It is `DataFrame.head()` and `DataFrame.columns`. Substitute your dataset in for DataFrame.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
#pre load the dataset into the exercise
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1742/datasets/cars_dataset_updated.csv')
print('cars dataset available to workspace')
```

*** =sct
```{python}
test_mc(5) # if 2 is the correct option.
success_msg("This one can be tricky!")

```

## Find Categorical Variables

It is not always intuitive to find categorical by eyeballing rows or inferring from the column names. 

Pandas `describe()` can help identify categorical variables with summary statistics. Unique values of each column can be printed through the `unique()` function. 

__Notice__: If datasets are of mixed type, continuous and categorical variables, then the `describe()` function defaults to summary statistics for continous variables. In this case, split columns by variable types before showing summary statistics.


*** =instructions
- Print summary statistics of `cars` dataset with describe()
- We are interested in the range or ratings customers gave to cars in this dataset. Print out the unique values for the `cusomter_rating` and `safety_level` columns. 

*** =hint
- What is the syntax using `describe()` pandas dataframes? DataFrame.describe()
- The pandas `unique()` function applies to Series or columns in pandas dataframes. What is the syntax for using `unique()`? df['column_name'].unique()

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
# I read the data in here again, just in case
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1742/datasets/cars_dataset_updated.csv')
print('cars dataset available to workspace')
```

*** =sample_code
```{python}
# Print summary statistics of `cars` dataset with describe()

# Print the unique categorical values for 'customer_rating' column

# Print the unique categorical values for 'safety_level' column

```

*** =solution
```{python}
# Print summary statistics of `cars` dataset with describe()
# for categorical variables describe() provides the count of unique categorical variables, most frequent category appearing in that columns, total frequency

print(cars.describe())

# Print the unique categorical values for 'customer_rating' column

cars['customer_rating'].unique()

# Print the unique categorical values for 'safety_level' column

cars['safety_level'].unique()

```

*** =sct
```{python}
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Encode Categorical Variables

Converting categories in text to numbers means that categories are encoded as unique integers. For example, `safety_level` variable has the values ['low', 'med', 'high'], which be encoded as [0, 1, 2]. 

We can write a function operator to convert the `customer_rating` column to encoded numerical values. We will use the output of your function operator as the target value for our decision tree.     


*** =instructions
- Create a function that will convert 
- 
*** =hint
- Columns can be explicitly excluded with `pd.drop(DataFrame.drop(column_name, inplace=False))`

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
# I read the data in here again, just in case
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1742/datasets/cars_dataset_updated.csv')
print('cars dataset available to workspace')

print('Print unique values for safety_level in cars dataset: ', cars['customer_rating'].unique())
```

*** =sample_code
```{python}
# sample code
```

*** =solution
```{python}
# solution code
cars['customer_rating'] = vehicles.type.map({'car':0, 'truck':1})

```

## Convert Categories to Dummies

Converting categories in text to numbers means that categories are encoded as unique integers. For example, `safety_level` variable has the following values: ['low', 'med', 'high']. These values can be encoded as [0, 1, 2].   

By contrast, the pandas `get_dummies` function returns a new column for each unique category, which indicates 0 (False) or 1 (True) for every row with or without each category value. 

For example, three imaginary records in `cars` dataset

| index  |safety_level   |  
|---|---|
| 0  | low  | 
| 1  | med  |  
| 2  | high  |  

through `pandas.get_dummies()` will become

| index  | low_safety_level  | med_safety_level  | high_safety_level  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| 2  | 0  | 0  | 1  |

*** =instructions
- Create a feature set of categorical variables with `get_dummies` with all columns except for `customer_rating'. 
- instruction 2

*** =hint
- Columns can be explicitly excluded with `pd.drop(DataFrame.drop(column_name, inplace=False))`

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
# I read the data in here again, just in case
import pandas as pd

cars = pd.read_csv('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1742/datasets/cars_dataset_updated.csv')
print('cars dataset available to workspace')

print('Print unique values for safety_level in cars dataset: ', cars['safety_level'].unique())
```

*** =sample_code
```{python}
# sample code
```

*** =solution
```{python}
# solution code
```

*** =sct
```{python}
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Find Categorical Variables

Sometimes it is not intuitive to see which variables are categorical by simply eyeballing a few rows or inferring from the column names. ## ADD THE PLOTTING FEATURE ONLY 

Pandas `describe()` can help identify categorical variables through quick summary statistics. 

As well as plotting the relationships between every variable and distribution of columns through seaborn `pairplot()` can further illustrate variable types. However, it is difficult to plot categorical variables as strings so let's do this after we convert these to numbers. 

*** =instructions
- Generate summary statistics of `cars` dataset
- Visualize pairwise relationship of variables using seaborn, remember to import the package

*** =hint
- What is the syntax using `describe()` with a pandas dataframe? DataFrame.describe()
- Did you remember to import the seaborn package before you tried to plot? 
- seaborn.pairplot method can provide some assistance with your plot

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
# pec
```

*** =sample_code
```{python}
# Generate summary statistics of dataset

# visualize pairwise relationship of variables using seaborn

```

*** =solution
```{python}
# print summary statistics of dataset
# for categorical variables describe() provides the count of unique categorical variables, most frequent category appearing in that columns, total frequency
cars.describe()

# visualize variables with seaborn
import seaborn as sns

sns.pairplot(cars) #insert dataset here
```
